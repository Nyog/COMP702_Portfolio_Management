I was told you had a proposal that was done by somebody else.
How did that happen?
No, no, because our mental state, our proposal, we write the wrong there from our canines because I don't know why.
No, I mean, what I was told it looked like you used somebody else's proposal as yours.
No, you haven't.
So how did that happen? You had Edmond Lai there?
No.
Well, how did that happen?
She said she was doing another assignment.
I mean, like, the obvious question.
You know, they said, I don't know.
And if you've been told or not, there's a big offense.
There's a big offense and you could lead to a very serious problem.
We're just waiting to see your performance here.
I don't know what we're going to do here, but we'll make some cool end of the semester when you do the midterm review.
Yeah, and it should not have happened. You just can't use anybody else's work and thinking it'll not be good.
Yeah.
And one of the stupid things was like using somebody else's.
And didn't even forget to change the name, which was there, it belonged to somebody else.
Oh.
But we've got this.
Actually, all the projects are different, actually, for different...
Project are different, but what you gave, you know, like, showed that it was a new awake.
Yeah.
I mean, the proposal, I'm putting on the pipeline that I report now, hit now.
So I'm coming from the perspective.
Yeah.
So you get something that actually showed the mentor and moderator was a new awake.
I know every project is different.
Yeah.
So you submitted something that was somebody else's work.
See, you're going quiet. If you had made that mistake, you would have defended and said,
no, I mean, this is our way.
Yeah.
Actually...
Yeah, but we've provided for our own idea.
And also, I...
Okay. I mean, it has happened.
I mean, you just have to have a chat with the student.
And how many meetings have you had this to be distributed so far?
Are you meeting with our regular basis? Quickly basis?
No.
Yeah.
Two weeks of learning?
No. Not quick. I've made a appointment for the student, but for now, it's even time.
Yeah.
I will have an award with team. You have to make sure you are having a weekly meeting with the student.
Did you see this piece of wind?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. What did you say?
I was right, because, like, the community teacher and parents, I was right.
Like, me, me. No, no, this one here, this bit, the podium, did he show it to him?
Oh, no.
He didn't make a final for this week.
Yeah. So, why are you meeting with me, with that client, showing something, you know, like...
Without even kind of getting a feedback from your mentor, whether this is right or not.
Your face is not free, but you want home, make a final for another student.
Yeah. I mean, you should be meeting, showing the work that you have done, before, if it was a industry client, you know, like, you look at the way you were doing things.
Yeah. You are reading, when you read the industry client, you, you know, like, this is the report.
You email the report beforehand, and you do a PowerPoint slide presentation, and you say, okay, this is what it is.
Yeah. You're not upset? So, this is not like, I mean, what it shows, that, I mean, this is good here, you've done some work.
Yeah. Whether this work is right or wrong, we don't show a seat.
At the moment, what I asked for, you are showing me a different understanding, because I expected this meeting to be an agreement of what I said is, I said,
I know what I said is, I scope. I expected that scope statement document to be with me.
I'm interested in the scope, nothing else. I want to see the scope. Yeah.
What I said that day, whether you've captured properly or not, and I expected that to come to me after your proposal presentation.
So, I don't know, you know, like, what you guys are doing. What you showing me here, I just don't know.
I mean, if it's like or not, I don't think you've captured what I said accurately, that day when you were talking about, you know, the project.
Yeah. Our, our, let me tell you, we showed, we showed the current policy and the front of those two reports.
Two reports, okay. I mean, this report will come afterwards. But what is that we have agreed that you'll be doing in this project?
I've heavily said that you recorded that. Yeah. But I haven't seen it. I haven't seen, you know, like, you have to write it down and send it back to the client, the scope statement document that you are following.
I haven't seen that. There's, there's, there's now an idea of scope statement document.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's all our proposals. I can show you.
I don't want to see now. Yeah. I mean, I'm looking treating me like I'm like you where I got millions of other stuff to do as a client, you know, when you work with that client, you do things you email that client.
So this is what, like we had a meeting, see if we are on the same page or not in terms of what you have agreed as a, or what you talk about the scope. And next week when you meet, we'll have a discussion so that we have got a written sign of scope statement document, and then you can start the work on the project.
Yeah.
Did you record that meeting that that? Yeah.
Yeah.
Go back and listen to that meeting. Yeah.
And clearly identify in a scope statement document what I have asked you to do.
And send me the scope statement document, the functional and non functional requirement.
And then you can see it's a big sit down, this Stephen sort it out, and then email it to me. Yeah.
Yeah.
The question is, our, our last meeting with Stephen is the, our scope is right, those two reports. And from those two reports.
So, I have to, I have to investigate what in portfolio management system looks like and where you'll implement it. Yeah.
So if you once you've done those two report, then you start working with Stephen identifying whom you're going to talk to to get ideas.
What exactly you're going to include as part of your portfolio management system, which either be implemented on the alternative system, whether it is share point or the other one.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I understand now. Yeah.
So your status report that is due, we have the written status report is due in this way. Yeah.
Yeah. You have to get and submit it in the present next week, and then you'll make that call what you have to do here. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
Are you, you might as well meet Stephen after this. Yeah.
We'll hang around here and wait for Stephen and ever meeting to sort because, you know, seriously, they can be a big issue.
I think, Jake, in the one, too.
Come outside. Yeah. We can go outside.
Yeah.
You made me this afterwards. No, no. I want you guys to follow the process.
Oh, okay. Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you. We're done. If you want to.
Yeah. Okay.
So I wanted to follow the process. First thing I like to see is copy statement document.
Okay. Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
We are standing here. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.
